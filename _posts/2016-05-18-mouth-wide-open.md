title:  "Sleeping with my mouth wide open"
---

This morning I woke up, Luke was being especially cuddly. I asked him if I'd been snoring, he said yes and told me he was worried that I'd bad dreams because my mouth was wide open when I was sleeping.

He was right, I couldnt stop thinking about the projects I was planning, wondering if I should even be in this country, thinking about the tornadoes of what ifs and unhappy endings.

He snuggled in and told me he love me. I told him his breath smelt, kissed his nose and sleepily put my head back into his neck crevace. He told me my breath smelt more, then I told him I loved him.

He gave me a special diamond ring last night.
