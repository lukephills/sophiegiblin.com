### Things that suck // 

Facebook algorithms phasing out my old life, not seeing my friend's faces, trying to fit in, figuring out how to make new friends, the exhaustion of earning lots of new people's trust, feeling lonely, being asleep when England's awake.

### Things that don't suck // 

Luke, my housemates, Tuco the cat, the medium that is Snapchat, the autumn sun in our living room, my family on FaceTime, doing a successful 3 point turn in the van, making black and white weaves, seeing ideas through with nice people, singing.
