<h3 class="center">ABOUT</h3>

Since <span class="bold-number">1989</span> art has been the language I speak and bible I swear by. My lifelong creative education, fused with insights from my somewhat overly enthusiastic big brother who studied artificial intelligence, along side my (dare I say it) slightly intimidating sister, who wanted to be a politician when she was 12, dramatically shaped my skill set and interests as an artist and curator today.

I find the internet fascinating and disturbing. I listen to science podcasts and pay attention at futurist talks. I am an ambassador for mental health and positive social change. As you read this, I'm researching a new exhibition exploring how technology has changed the human workforce and as a result, impacted our psychological state. I've also recently been awarded funding to collborate with two artists in Wellington to explore cyber-bulling and feminism.

I'm influenced by incredible humans like Ken Robinson, writer and educator, a true patron of creativity. He brings emotional intelligence back into education. Marina Abramovic, a powerful performance artist who puts energy into collaboration and teaching. Finally, Hans Ulrich Obrist a curator, historian and critic, who spends his weekends visiting emerging artists around the world to shape their work for exhibitions.

<h3 class="center">EXPERIENCE</h3>

###### August 2013 - ongoing

##### Kollektiv Gallery - Director
Three years ago I founded Kollektiv Gallery. This award winning inititive designs and runs educational programmes, to cultivate confidence in early career artists. Together with the participants, I run crowdfunding campaigns to turn empty buildings into public art spaces. I interview artists globally for the Kollektiv website and publish extensive manuals to teach people how to crowdfund and open galleries. I have organised 8 exhibitions in England and interviewed over 200 creatives.

###### February 2016 – ongoing

##### Lokal Stories - Fundraiser, Project Manager and Curator
After only three months since moving to Wellington, I developed relationships with organisations and artists to showcase a new exhibition, entitled Lokal Stories. I am working with moving image and spoken word artists, Jordana Bragg and Hana Aoake, to explore cyberbullying towards women online. We have been awarded City Council funding to organise and curate a public display of visual conversations between the artists in vacant building windows in Te Aro.

###### August 2016 - ongoing

##### Femur Design - Digital App Strategist
During the last 2 years, I have worked alongside Luke Phillips, musician and developer. Together we design instant and intuitive apps which reach an enormous global audience. Our collaboration has taught me the importance of technology. This fast paced and ever expanding industry should be explored in the art and culture sector. I am always looking for new ways to fuse them together.

###### May 2014 - ongoing

##### Fast Art - Workshop Designer and Leader
The premise of Fast Art is to start, finish and sell an idea under 2 hours. It was designed in order to practice and share entrepreneurial and creative skills. I teach schools, universities, educators and organisations. The workshop is fun, it brings teams together and ignites creative ambition.

###### 2013 - ongoing

##### Public Speaker and Educator
I tell stories and share my experiences about starting-up Kollektiv Gallery. I have spoken at events all over the UK and Europe to encourage creatives to be proactive and make social change in their community.
