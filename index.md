<h3 class="center">ABOUT</h3>

Since <span class="bold-number">1989</span>, art has been the language I speak and the bible I swear by. My lifelong creative education, fused with insights from my overly enthusiastic big brother who studied artificial intelligence, alongside my (dare I say it) intimidating sister, who wanted to be a politician when she was 12, dramatically shaped my skill set and interests as an artist and curator today.

I find the internet fascinating and disturbing. I listen to science podcasts and pay attention at futurist talks. Human emotion, social action and strengthening communities, play a huge role in my projects. As you read this, I'm planning a new exhibition which explores how technology has changed the human workforce and as a result, impacted our psychological state. 

I'm influenced by incredible humans like Ken Robinson, writer and educator, a true patron of creativity, he brings emotional intelligence back into education. Marina Abramovic, a powerful performance artist who puts energy into collaboration and teaching. §Hans Ulrich Obrist a curator, historian and critic, who spends his weekends visiting emerging artists around the world to shape their work for exhibitions.

Finally, I'm honoured to annouce that I have been awarded Wellington Council and Creative New Zealand funding to curate the first ever Lokal Stories, with two emerging Māori / Pākehā feminist artists and writers. Our collboration will explore and dismantle the ways in which the hetero-patriarchal, neo-colonial culture we live in has shaped online identities and harassment today.

###### August 2013 - ongoing

##### [Kollektiv Gallery](http://www.kollektivgallery.com/) - Director
Three years ago I founded Kollektiv Gallery. This award winning inititive designs and runs educational programmes to cultivate confidence in early career artists. Together with the participants, I run crowdfunding campaigns to turn empty buildings into public art spaces.

I have organised 8 exhibitions in England and interviewed over 200 creatives.

##### Lokal Stories - Fundraiser, Project Manager and Curator

I am working with moving image and spoken word artists, Jordana Bragg and Hana Aoake, to explore cyberbullying towards womyn online.

During the last 2 years, I have worked alongside Luke Phillips, musician and developer. Together we design instant and intuitive apps which reach an enormous global audience.

I am always looking for new ways to fuse them together.
