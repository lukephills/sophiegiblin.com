<h3 class="center">GIRL-STFF</h3>
 
My father photographed family situations; us as children, the birthdays, the garden, his wife. Sometimes he's give the camera to my mother, whose glasses were always extremely thick. I remember one photograph my mother took of my older brother when he was just a small todler. He was playing in long grass running towards her. The long yellow grass was perfectly in forcus, and my brother out of focus. 

Bluring, morphing, augmenting, ripping people in photographs has always intersted me because of this photograph.
